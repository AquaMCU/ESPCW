# ESPCW
Morse Code Decoder / Encoder with ESP8266

Hello Ham Operators.

I basically want to connect an ESP8266 with a cheap Ham Radio ( for example a Baofeng ) and send and receive cw.

This project consists of two parts:

- Hardware: A small PCB that has a tone detector, a tone generator and a PTT cirquit
- Software: A small lib that enables sending and receiving cw

I want to capsule the cw part in a lib, so it can be used in several projects.

Looking forward for your feedback

I am basing this works on the below mentioned website:
